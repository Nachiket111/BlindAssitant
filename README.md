🎯 Object Detection with Audio Output: Empowering the Visually Impaired

📝 Project Overview : This project is an innovative solution designed to assist visually impaired and blind individuals. By combining real-time object detection with audio feedback and distance estimation, the system enables users to perceive their surroundings effectively and navigate safely.

✨ Features :

Real-Time Object Detection
Detects and identifies objects using a pre-trained model.
Audio Output
Announces detected objects via real-time audio feedback.
Distance Estimation
Estimates and announces the proximity of detected objects.
🔧 Technologies Used :

COCO Dataset: Used to train and fine-tune the detection models.
SSDMobileNet: Lightweight and efficient for real-time applications.
RCNN: Offers higher accuracy for more complex object detection tasks.
OpenCV: For processing video input and integrating detection.
Python: Core programming language.
🌟 Benefits :

Enhances accessibility for visually impaired individuals.
Improves navigation safety with distance estimation.
Offers a lightweight yet robust system for real-time use.
🚀 How It Works :

The system captures video input via a connected camera.
Objects in the frame are detected using a SSDMobileNet or RCNN model trained on the COCO dataset.
Identified objects are announced through an audio system.
Distance to each detected object is calculated and relayed to the user.
